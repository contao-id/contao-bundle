<!--
Replace this notice by a description of your feature/bugfix.
This will help reviewers and should be a good start for the documentation.

Additionally:
 - Always add tests and ensure they pass.
 - Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply
   (lowest branches are regularly merged to upper ones so they get the fixes too).
 - Features and deprecations must be submitted against the latest branch.
 - For new features, provide some code snippets to help understand usage.
 - Never break backward compatibility.
